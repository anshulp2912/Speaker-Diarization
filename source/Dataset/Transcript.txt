I don't want her to hurt herself what 
about a Barbie doll set I don't think so 
she has many Barbie dolls have you got 
anything educational you see she's a 
very intelligent girl I've got the 
perfect thing I do it yourself kit where 
you can build your own Barbie doll who 
rides a skateboard

not sure well here's a seating plan of 
the concert hall how much is it in the 
middle section $50 $50 that's a little 
too expensive for us how much is it in 
the back 
$35 that's fine what time does the play

time now about 7:10 there's no hurry 
it only takes 10 minutes by car to get 
there I know but there aren't enough 
parking spaces around the theater well 
I'd better tell grace to hurry up she 
can take hours to get ready 
an interesting movie 
I thought that movie was terrific didn't 
you I don't know it didn't seem to have 
any meaning come on it seems that you 
expect intellectual stimulation from 
every movie I just think that a good 
movie should have a central theme at 
least yes but it doesn't hurt you to 
watch a funny movie once in a while 
relax and enjoy it you're right I'm too 
serious sometimes 
in the bus I see you're reading Harry 
Potter how do you like it I can't put it 
down

finished it the endings great don't tell 
me I have only 50 pages to go okay I 
won't tell you who died tell me anything 
okay but I'm biting my tongue 
good bye hard such a shame though what 
is that Harry dies

already tired of doing the same thing

bored oh come on it's not that bad

disease yeah mrs. Smith had it for five 
years before she died did they try 
surgery she had two operations but they 
weren't effective I feel sorry for mr. 
Smith

news in the Wallace family no I've been 
out of town 
mrs. Wallace went into the hospital last 
night and gave birth to a baby girl 
seven hours later that's very good but 
they already have a little girl don't 
they know they have a five year old boy 
so they wanted a girl this time right
